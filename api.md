Programmatic access to many of ZONZAs features is possible via our public API.
This allows clients to integrate ZONZA with other systems or perform reporting
tasks for example. `http://api.zonza.tv` is a RESTful JSON-based API and thus
can be used from any programming language or any HTTP client (including
browser extensions such as [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/)).

### Great, how do I get started?

Access is controlled using your ZONZA username and API token which is visible
on your ZONZA user profile page. Your account must also have permission to
make API calls so if you do not see your API token then please contact your
Account Director. Once you've got your credentials, simply start making HTTP
requests using the appropriate headers, for example:

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl \
    -H "Bork-Token: <YOUR_TOKEN>" \
    -H "Bork-Username: <YOUR_USERNAME>" \
    http://api.zonza.tv:8080/v0/item
{
  "hits": "1",
  "item": [
      {
        "id": "VX-336335",
        "url": "http://api.zonza.tv:8080/v0/item/VX-336335"
      }
    ]
}
{% endhighlight %}
