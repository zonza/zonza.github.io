Advertising.

### What is Ad-ID?

Ad-ID is an industry standard for identifying advertising assets across all
media platforms. Since 31st March 2014, all commercials produced for
television, radio and digital platforms featuring SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors
Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) union members,
must now use Ad-ID as the sole standard commercial identifier and thus we
expect an increasing number of clients to expect support for it.

Ad-ID also refers to the paid service and web-based system available at
[http://ad-id.org](http://ad-id.org) that generates, and manages unique
codes for each asset. In addition the system stores a set of basic metadata
often referred to as a digital slate. This digital slate comprises a
standard set of mandatory and non-mandatory metadata fields that can be
stored centrally in the Ad-ID system and also embedded into assets using
the Adobe XMP protocol.

### How does ZONZA support Ad-ID?

Once Ad-ID has been configured for a client site, we support:

* Automatic retrieval of metadata from the Ad-ID service into ZONZA once an
  asset has been linked to an Ad-ID identifier
* Search of assets in ZONZA using the Ad-ID identifier and metadata
* Automatic updating of metadata in ZONZA if it changes in the Ad-ID portal

### Cool, how do I get started?

You must first have an Ad-ID account and have access to some codes. You can
register for a new account at
[http://app.ad-id.org/user/register](http://app.ad-id.org/user/register).

In order to pull Ad-ID information into ZONZA, weâ€™ll need to have you share
your Ad-ID codes with an account we create specifically for ZONZA to access
the data. We will also need to configure your site to enable support. Your
account manager can tell you the account details and confirm that we have
configured your site.

If you log in to [http://app.ad-id.org](http://app.ad-id.org) with your
existing account and share the desired codes/groups/prefixes with the account
we give you then ZONZA will be able to retrieve them. You only need to grant
Read-only access. You should be able to access your codes from ZONZA shortly
afterwards.
